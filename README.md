A compilation of spatial covariates data of landscape, topographic, hydrological, and anthropogenic metrics for the entire AF at fine spatial resolution (30-m) for the year 2020.

ATLANTIC SPATIAL dataset is part of the <a href="https://github.com/LEEClab/Atlantic_series">ATLANTIC series</a>, on which research teams are compiling biodiversity information of Atlantic Forest. This paper follows previous published data papers in <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/toc/10.1002/(ISSN)1939-9170.AtlanticPapers">Ecology</a>.

## Abstract

<p align="justify">

Space is one of the main drivers of biodiversity, once it regulates the underlying processes affecting the distribution and dynamics of species and communities. It is a fundamental factor in face of the rapid climate and land use and land cover changes at local and global scales, which are linked to habitat loss and fragmentation and their impacts on various organisms. The Atlantic Forest of South America (AF) is among the global biodiversity hotspots because of its high species richness and endemism. Most of the threats to the AF biodiversity are due to the expansion of urbanization and industry, extensive agricultural and livestock production, and mining. Here, we make available integrated and fine-scale spatial information (resolution = 30 m) for the entire AF extent for the year 2020. The metrics consider different vegetation classes (forest and forest plus other natural vegetation), effects of linear structure (roads and railways) and multiple scales (radius buffer from 50 m to 2,500 m and up to 10 km for some metrics). The entire data set consists of over 500 rasters and the AF delimitation vector, available through the R package [_atlanticr_](https://github.com/mauriciovancine/atlanticr), which we developed to facilitate the organization and acquisition of the data. The metrics consists of land cover (31 classes), distance to grouped land cover classes (forest vegetation, natural vegetation, pasture, temporary crop, perennial crop, forest plantation, urban areas, mining, and water), a set of landscape, topographic and hydrological metrics, and anthropogenic infrastructure. The landscape metrics include landscape morphology (classification as matrix, core, edge, corridor, stepping stone, branch, and perforation), fragment area and proportion, area and number of patches, edge and core areas and proportion, structural and functional connectivity (for different organisms’ gap-crossing capabilities), distance to fragment edges, fragment perimeter and perimeter-area ratio, and landscape diversity. Topographic metrics include elevation, slope, aspect, curvatures, and landform elements (peak, ridge, shoulder, spur, slope, hollow, footslope, valley, pit and ﬂat). Hydrological metrics comprise potential springs and its kernel density and potential streams and the respective distances, and anthropogenic infrastructure maps contain roads, railways, protected areas, indigenous territories, and quilombola territories, and the respective distance to each of them. This data set will allow efficient integration of biodiversity and environmental data for the AF in future ecological studies, and we might be an important reference and data source for landscape planning, biodiversity conservation and forest restoration programs.

## Access to the data

### Zenodo

The data sets are archived in a series of Zenodo repositores, where one might see the metadata and download the layers manually. The repositories are organized thematically according to types of metrics, as described below:

### R package

We also created the R package [atlanticr](https://mauriciovancine.github.io/atlanticr/) which, in addition to facilitating access to other data papers, provides a table with all metrics and their information "atlantic_spatial" and a function to download rasters "atlantic_spatial_download()".

```{r}
# install package
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mauriciovancine/atlanticr")

# load package
library(atlanticr)

# list files
head(atlanticr::atlantic_spatial)

# file download
atlanticr::atlantic_spatial_download(id = 1, path = ".")
```

This allows for automated and sequential access to the data, complementing the direct access to individual files from the Zenodo repositores shown above.
